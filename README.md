The codes are consistent with the data wrangling tools present in the book 
"Data Wrangling with Python written by Jacqueline Kazil and Katharine Jarmul"

I have changed certain major areas in the code such as using PyPDF2 rather 
than slate as originally used in the book

I am using xlrd, xlwd, xutils for scraping data from the excel file
